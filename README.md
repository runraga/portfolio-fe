### Overview

This simple, reponsive portfolio website was developed to showcase projects I have completed. It connects through the GitHub api to pull down all public repositories. The information displayed is from the repo README along with a headline graphic. While I'm not a front end developer (hence the simplicity of the webiste) this was a really fun project and allowed me to continue my learning following completion of the Northcoders course. I gained an appreaciate of responsive website design and full stack CI/CD using GitHub workflow as well a working with hosted website using cPanel.

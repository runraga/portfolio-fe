# Portfolio Website

### Short description

A simple portfolio website built with React 18, TypeScript and Chakra-UI to showcase projects that I have developed. 

### Languages used

- TypeScript
- React
- GitHub Workflow

### Overview

This simple, reponsive portfolio website was developed to showcase projects I have completed. It connects through the GitHub api to pull down all public repositories. The information displayed is from the repo README along with a headline graphic. While I'm not a front end developer (hence the simplicity of the webiste) this was a really fun project and allowed me to continue my learning following completion of the Northcoders course. I gained an appreaciate of responsive website design using Chakra-UI and full stack CI/CD using GitHub workflow as well a working with hosted website using cPanel.

### Future Features

- load project text and graphic separately using chakra-ui skeletons.
- Display a message if there is any problem/error with the API backend.
